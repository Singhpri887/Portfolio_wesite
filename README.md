# Portfolio_wesite
I developed a personal portfolio website as part of my beginner web development training. This project involved creating a multi-section webpage to showcase my profile, skills, projects, and contact information. I used HTML to structure the content and CSS to design and style the layout, making it visually appealing and responsive.
